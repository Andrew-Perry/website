            <h1 class="display-1 text-center p-4 m-4">10 Tips to Improve your Builds</h1>
            <hr>
            <h1 class="display-6 p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">1. Plan your Builds</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">This could be different for everyone or per build. 
            Planning could be as simple as a sketch, or could be a whole outline. Just remember, 
            forgetting to plan your build could result in having destroying your whole build
            over and over again.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="display-6 p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">2. Choose a Base Block Palette</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">Whether you're working on a single build, or an entire city, 
            a block palette can be a seriously helpful aid in creating aesthetically pleasing builds. 
            Picking out a set of blocks that look good together in isolation will ensure any resulting 
            builds look great.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="display-6 p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">3. Bigger Doesn't Always Mean Better</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking the best way to make 
            your build look good is to simply make it as big as possible, especially in 1.18's larger worlds. 
            In reality, while large-scale builds can be fantastic, small builds are often just as impressive - 
            if not more so, given the difficulties of capturing detail at a small scale in Minecraft's cubic system.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="display-6 p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">4. Play Around With all Wood Types</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">The various types of wood block are undoubtedly core materials for many a builder, 
            but mixing and matching two or more different types of wood, as well as working log and stripped 
            log into the build in addition to planks, can actually create some really striking designs.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="display-6 p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">5. Add Depth to your Builds</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">Given the ubiquity of 90-degree angles in Minecraft, 
            it can be easy for things to feel a bit flat. One way to make things stand out is to use depth in your walls. 
            Build them across a couple of blocks, with beams sticking out across the front. Or use stairs, walls, 
            and slabs to mix things up - both are great ways to make things a bit more exciting.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="display-6 p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">6. Variate Flat Surfaces</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">For any given block in Minecraft, there are a handful of others with 
            similar colors and even textures. Mixing such blocks together in walls, floors, 
            and anything else - either randomly or in patches - can be a fantastic way to stop 
            things from becoming a bit flat or monotone.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="display-6 p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">7. Design the Interiors of you Buildings</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">When working on a build, many players put hours 
            into making the outside look amazing, and then all the inside gets is some carpet, 
            a furnace and a crafting table, and some chests next to a bed. A great way to take your build to the 
            next level is to make it look fantastic both inside and out.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="display-6 p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">8. Add Small Features</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">Once you've got your buildings sorted and connected them all up with pretty paths, 
            it can be a great idea to add some custom builds along said path to really make the area come alive. 
            Things like ponds, campsites, or even just benches are great for adding atmosphere to an area.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="display-6  p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">9. Use Natural Environments in your Builds</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">When most people think of a Minecraft house, they picture a build standing in a 
            field, desert, forest clearing, or some other clear area. However, if you're willing to get creative 
            with your choice of terrain, you can design some really unique and impressive builds.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="display-6 p-4 m-4 text-center bg-secondary rounded">10. Always be on the Lookout for Inspiration</h1>
            <p class="text-center m-3">The Minecraft community is absolutely massive and filled to the brim with
            talented builders and amazing constructions. Definitely don't steal people's designs outright, 
            but taking ideas such as block combinations or color palettes is a great way to improve.</p>
