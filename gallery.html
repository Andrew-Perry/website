                                This is a very impressive building. Although the color palette is very simple, this building is able to capture your attention.
                                One ways that the builder did this is by allowing you to imagine what this building would have looked like had the dragon
                                not burned everything.

                                This build is a very massive city surrounding one very tall castle. Pay close attention to the lighting.
                                Although the building is still lit, there aren't a large amount of torches every. Also, pay attention to
                                what buildings are the focal point and how they achieve the affect of being the focus.

                                Although this build is very large, the creator didn't lose the attention to small detail. When looking at this build,
                                pay attention to the color palette as well as the small details that are included in the buil.

                                Although this build is very simple, it manages to catch the eye. One of the ways that this build did this is because of the
                                landscape. Rather than being a flat world, this master builder, built this castle around mountains and really fit it into
                                the world.

                                Like the previous build, this build is very simple yet grabs the eye. One of the ways that it did this, like the previous build,
                                really incorporated the build into the landscape. Another thing that this build did was apply wind to it's build. You can see this 
                                because of the flags flying in the wind.
